What We Do With The Bees?



QueenB Live Bee Removal focus solely on live bee removals in an effort to regain a bee population within San Diego, CA. As part of a group of beekeepers we restore hives back to health and keep them for local honey production as well as garden pollination

Why are bees inportant? 

The World has a shortage, and without bees we will feel the effects locally as well. Southern California could lose 20+ crops that are 95-100% dependent on honeybee pollination. We Save Bees is leading the Country in successful live bee removal as 92% of our hives are relocated to farms for pollination. We have these results because We Save Bees does each removal live and by hand. We do not use ‘bee vacuums’ as they kill bees as well as the chemicals do. In Southern California, each home will average one hive per twenty years. Each home can choose to have a live bee removal. We all can make a difference… save the bees and help save the world.
